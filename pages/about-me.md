I began practicing yoga, mindfulness and meditation at the age of 18 while earning my bachelor’s degree in psychology from Vassar College.  I completed her yoga teacher training at Yoga Tree in San Francisco under the expert instruction of many of California’s most renowned teachers. I have also studied yoga with Rod Stryker, Annie Carpenter, Bryan Kest and am especially grateful for the instruction, encouragement and bhakti inspiration I have received from Daniel Stewart, Lauren Peterson, and Noelle Beaugureau. 

Apart from my studies in yoga, I have studied meditation under the tutelage of Jack Kornfield and other distinguished teachers at Spirit Rock Insight Meditation Center. I am also a student of qigong, taoist internal energy arts and mediation, having studied primarily with Sifu Carl Totton.

I currently live in Greenbrae, CA with my wonderful husband, and our dog child. I am so blessed with our shared love, support, and inspiration.
