At the age of 18 I began practicing yoga, mindfulness and meditation  while earning my bachelor’s degree in psychology from Vassar College.  I completed my yoga teacher training at Yoga Tree in San Francisco under the expert instruction of many of California’s most renowned teachers. I am especially grateful for the instruction, encouragement and inspiration I have received from Ram Dass, Daniel Stewart, Lauren Peterson, and Noelle Beaugureau. 
 
Apart from my studies in Indian yoga, I am student of Buddhist and Taoist philosophy and practices. Under the tutelage of Jack Kornfield and other distinguished teachers at Spirit Rock I study meditation. Additionally, I am a student of qigong, Taoist internal energy arts and mediation, having studied primarily with Sifu Carl Totton.
 
Currently I live in Marin County, CA with my wonderful husband, Jess, and our ridiculously cute dog, Fonzie. I am so grateful for all their love, support, and inspiration.
